Router Middleware

Routing defines the way in which the client requests are 
handled by the application endpoints. And when you make 
some routers in separate file, you can use them by using middleware.

Middleware functions are a really great way to run code on each 
request, or on each request for a certain route, and to take action
on request or response data. Middleware is a crucial piece of any
modern web server, and is incredibly useful.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request 
object ( req ), the response object ( res ), and the next function 
in the application's request-response cycle. The next function is a 
function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the 
middleware succeeding the current middleware.
