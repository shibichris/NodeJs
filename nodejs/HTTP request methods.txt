Routing is made from the word route. It is used to determine the 
specific behavior of an application. It specifies how an application
responds to a client request to a particular route, URI or path and
a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, etc.). 
It can handle different types of HTTP requests.
You can edit and update a particular account through a PUT request.

In index.js, append .put() to your app variable and include the route 
as the first argument. You will find the inputted account ID, 
and set a conditional to update with new data
You can delete users and data using the DELETE request method.

Within index.js, append .delete() to your app variable, and include
as the first argument. You will filter through the accounts array 
and return the account to delete.
To create new data in the accounts array, you can integrate a POST request method.

In index.js, append .post() to your app variable, and include the route as the first argument
