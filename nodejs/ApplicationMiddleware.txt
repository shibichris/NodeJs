Application-level middleware

Application-level middleware is a type of middleware that generally 
runs throughout the whole application. In the case of express.js, this 
kind of middleware are bound to the application by using app.use(). 
This means a middleware will be executed for all endpoints set 
in the application, unless we specify a specific path.

METHOD() functions, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request 
that the middleware function handles (such as GET, PUT, or POST) in
 lowercase. This example shows a middleware function with no mount 
path. The function is executed every time the app receives a request.
