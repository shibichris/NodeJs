Routing
Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. 
For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing.

You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; 
for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. 
For a full list, see app.METHOD. You can also use app.all() to handle all HTTP methods 
and app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function (See Using middleware for details).

These routing methods specify a callback function (sometimes called “handler functions”) 
called when the application receives a request to the specified route (endpoint) and HTTP method. 
In other words, the application “listens” for requests that match the specified route(s) 
and method(s), and when it detects a match, it calls the specified callback function.

In fact, the routing methods can have more than one callback function as arguments. 
With multiple callback functions, it is important to provide next as an argument to the 
callback function and then call next() within the body of the function to hand off 
control to the next callback.
